The Big-o analysis of a algorithm is essentially an estimated calculation of how many times a program will go through each line
It also calculates how long it will take the program to run in the best and worst circumstances
For the Insertion sort best case scenario the best it will run will be when the numbers are already sorted
In terms of Big-o analysis the Insertion sort's best case scenario is O(n)
What this means is that for each line the driving force of how long the program will run is how many variables there are in the list we are sorting
The worst case scenario for Insertion sort is O(n^2)
This means that for each line the driving force of the runtime of the program will be the number of variables there are in the list we are sorting squared
The best case for BubbleSort is also O(n) and the worst case for Bubblesort is also O(n^2)
